## Credit Default 
***This project analyzes a credit card client dataset to predict the likelihood of default in the next payment cycle. It includes exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, feature scaling, imbalance techniques, and model training. Multiple algorithms such as Decision Trees, XGBoost, and ANN are evaluated. The goal is to build an accurate and interpretable credit default prediction system.***
